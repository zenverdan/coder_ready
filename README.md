## Day 1 - Basic Python
The first day of the workshop focuses on introducing participants to the basics of Python programming. This includes:

- Installing Python
- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures (if/else statements, loops)
- Functions
- Modules and packages

Participants will have the opportunity to write and run simple Python programs, and will be provided with resources and guidance to continue their learning beyond the workshop.

## Day 2 - Python OOPs and Calculator App using Tkinter
The second day of the workshop focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python and creating a calculator app using the Tkinter library. This includes:

- What is OOP?
--- Classes and objects
---Inheritance and polymorphism
- Creating a calculator app using Tkinter

Participants will learn how to structure code using OOP principles and will be guided through the process of building a simple calculator app using the Tkinter library.

## Day 3 - Data Analysis the Airline Data
The third day of the workshop focuses on data analysis using Python. Participants will use real-world airline data to explore data analysis concepts such as:

- Reading data into Python
- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Data visualization
- Basic statistical analysis

Participants will work through a series of exercises to gain practical experience with data analysis in Python.

### Organization
This workshop is organized by Coder Ready, a leading provider of coding education and training resources. The materials in this repository are designed to be used in conjunction with the workshop, but can also be used as a standalone resource for learning Python, OOP, and data analysis.

We hope you find this workshop and its materials useful! Please feel free to reach out to us with any questions or feedback.
